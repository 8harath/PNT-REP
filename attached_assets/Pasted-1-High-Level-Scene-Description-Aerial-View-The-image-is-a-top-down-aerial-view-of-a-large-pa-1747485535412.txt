1. High-Level Scene Description (Aerial View)

    The image is a top-down aerial view of a large parking lot.

    There are multiple vertical lanes of parked vehicles separated by islands (concrete dividers with poles/trees).

    The parking lot layout is grid-based, with each row containing standard car-sized slots.

    Some areas show handicap parking (blue lines) and diagonal striping, likely indicating no-parking or restricted zones.

    Vehicles of varying sizes, types, colors, and orientations are visible.

2. Key Elements to Detect

Here’s what the model would ideally detect:

    Total number of parking slots (occupied + unoccupied)

    Occupied parking slots

    Empty parking slots

    Trucks or vehicles occupying multiple slots

    Misaligned / improperly parked vehicles

    Moving vehicles (cars not inside a slot, possibly driving)

    Non-standard objects (e.g., trailers, food trucks, construction gear)

    Areas with no valid parking (yellow cross-hatched zones)

3. Edge Cases / Challenges for the Model
a. Trucks/Trailers occupying multiple slots

    There are at least 3 large trucks or trailers occupying 3 to 4 car-sized slots.

    This requires the model to segment large objects and determine how many slots they block.

b. Irregular parking (misaligned or diagonal vehicles)

    Some vehicles are parked not aligned perfectly within the white lines, affecting slot-level detection.

    At least 2–3 vehicles are protruding out or diagonally placed.

c. Moving vehicles

    A few vehicles are not parked but are either moving or idle within drive lanes.

    Example: A white car at the center-right and red vehicle at the top-center angled diagonally—these should not be counted as occupying slots.

d. Color & Lighting Variation

    There is no dominant vehicle color, and some shadows from dividers or structures may affect detection contrast.

    The system needs robust instance segmentation with color invariance.

e. Special zones

    Some areas have:

        Blue painted lines – usually for handicapped spots.

        Yellow striped zones – non-parking areas.

        These should be excluded from total slot counts.

f. Slot Markings Occlusion

    In some cases, slot boundaries are not clearly visible, especially under:

        Long vehicles

        Shadowed areas

        Trucks blocking 2+ slots

    The model should infer slot locations based on parking grid layout extrapolation.

4. Additional Observations
Observation	Impact
Vehicles are parked on both sides of dividers	Increases complexity of associating cars to slots
Some slots are completely empty	Good for validation of empty slot detection
Long concrete dividers split every two lanes	Useful landmarks for grid alignment
One red car at the far bottom outside slot grid	Edge case of non-parking zone occupation
5. Model Design Considerations

To address the above, your model needs:

    Semantic Segmentation for:

        Parking slot lines

        Special zones

    Instance Segmentation or Object Detection for:

        Cars, trucks, trailers

    Heuristics or Post-processing for:

        Slot-car association

        Inferring partially visible slots

    Perspective correction or grid fitting to align the virtual grid over the parking layout
